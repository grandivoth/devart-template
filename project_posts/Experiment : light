Experiment : light

Light: I've tried taking multiple images at one time , which can be stacked on youtube
by the alpha value of each = 1 / Photo . After the trial , it can be concluded that if the light 
in a certain time period to another, you can see the movement of light and balance beautifully , as if to
each image of the sea several times. Althoght in the sea have many wave,but when we bring multi-picture to overlap .
The last picture has try to reduce different of picture .so, there are no waves (noise) 
of each image in different positions . Make a picture with an alpha value equal to the cut , but the big difference 
between each picture was taken away. Make a picture that looks like a still calm .

To conclude,We use all information to present the installation art and applications to Life(emtion) by time.
